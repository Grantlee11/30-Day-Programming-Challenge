# 30-Day-Programming-Challenge

This a 30 Day Programming Challenge Repository. I'll upload a new program contained in a single Java file each day to this repository and update the ReadMe as needed to explain each new file.

Day 1: I created a ReverseALinkedList.java program that reverses a Linked List using Java's built in Stack methods.

Day 2: I created a LinkedList.java program that allows the user to add names to the front or back of the Linked List and then display them in the correct order of the list. I largely created this Linked List without the aid of Java's built in Linked List Methods.
