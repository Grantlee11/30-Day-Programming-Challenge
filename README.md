# 30-Day-Programming-Challenge

This a 30 Day Programming Challenge Repository. I'll upload a new program contained in a single Java file each day to this repository and update the ReadMe as needed to explain each new file.

Day 1: I created a ReverseALinkedList.java program that reverses a Linked List using Java's built in Stack methods.

Day 2: I created a LinkedList.java program that allows the user to add names to the front or back of the Linked List and then display them in the correct order of the list. I created this Linked List without the aid of Java's built in Linked List Methods.

Day 3: I created a BST.java program that allows the user to add integer values to a Binary Search Tree and then display the tree with inorder traversal, preorder traversal, or postorder traversal. 

Day 4: I created a BinarySearch.java program that allows the user to use a binarySearch method on an array and search for the element in the array.

Day 5: I created a BubbleSort.java program that implements a Bubble Sort method and prints out the predetermined array to the screen.

Pause: I took a bit of a break with the holidays and new semester starting, but am now resuming the challenge

Day 6: I created a SLMP.java program that implements the Sorted List Matching programming method. It takes 2 arrays and prints out the commonality between them.
